Hey! Today we're learning how to add to someone's point in a group discussion.

In a GD, it's important to build on what others say.

button_text: Cool!

message:
When you want to add new information to someone's point, use this structure:
""I'd like to add that [new information].""

For example: ""I'd like to add that online shopping also offers more discounts during festivals.""
image_url: 
button_text: Got it!

message:
Here's another example.
If someone talks about work from home, you can say:

""I'd like to add that many companies now allow employees to work from home.""

button_text: Next!

message:
This phrase shows you are listening and contributing something new to the discussion.

It makes your point sound polite and respectful.
